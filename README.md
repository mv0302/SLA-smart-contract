# SLA-smart-contract
A smart contract for Service Level Agreement
Cloud Computing and Blockchain can bring in new possibilities and solve some more problems. This project provides a approach in which the Service Level Agreement (SLA) in cloud is written using Smart Contract in blockchain. This will enable the SLA to function automatically due to the code written in the smart contract. 
The Smart contract takes the addresses of SP(service provider) and client, total service period, penalty amount. The function createSLA creates the contract, the contract has to be approved by both the SP and the client, the calculatePenaltyAmount functions calculates the total amount payable by the client and the completeService function terminates the contract.
